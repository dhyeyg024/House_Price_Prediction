# House_Price_Prediction
A Data Science project where I have made a ML model to predict the price of the houses based on 3 features; total square feet, number of bedrooms and number of bathrooms. Integrated the ML model with Flask in the backend and developed the UI for users. 

In Project Folder 
---> there is a 'model' folder under which there is a Dataset, code to build model(jupyter notebook), ML model and one JSON file is present.
---> there is a "client" folder under which the files contining html, css and js code is present.
---> there is a 'server' folder under which code of Flask is executed.
